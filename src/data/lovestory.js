    For me, Hope’s and my love story started months before we actually met.
    After I submitted my application, Peace Corps headquarters ignored my ranked
    country preferences and decided to send me to the Dominican Republic, which
    was nowhere on my application. I now consider this “glitch” to be fate. By
    the time I got to the D.R., Hope had already been a Peace Corps Volunteer
    for a year, and throughout training I just kept hearing stories about this
    larger-than-life guy named Hope.
  </div>,
  <div>
    When I finally met him, I confirmed the rumors were true: he was unlike
    anyone I had ever met before, and in the best way. Hope has the ability to
    light up any room, quick to make friends with strangers and fill silence
    with his distinct laugh. One night, after coming back to the Peace Corps
    hostel after a volunteer Thanksgiving celebration, I (as a Christmas
    fanatic) followed the sound of Christmas music to the hostel lobby, where
    Hope was curating the perfect Christmas playlist. We stayed up until 4am
    debating the greatest Christmas hits, discussing Zingerman’s and Ann Arbor,
    and exchanging stories about our Peace Corps experiences. I left our
    conversation determined to get to know Hope better. As our host communities
    were two long bus rides apart, we fell in love over hours and hours of flip
    phone conversations, never running out of things to talk about.

    Hope and I hit pause on our relationship when he wrapped up his Peace Corps
    service a year ahead of me. After a year of zero communication between us, I
    was pleasantly surprised to receive an email out of the blue from Hope in
    late 2018, asking to reconnect. We set up a phone call (this time using
    iPhones, not flip phones) when I got back to the U.S., and Hope pulled a
    move from a rom com, revealing that he had never lost feelings for me and
    asking if he could visit me in California the following month. Of course, I
    said yes, and the rest is history!
  </div>,
  <div>
    Since picking up our relationship again stateside, we have laughed, loved,
    and grown together over the past 4.5 years. We have lived together in D.C.
    and now Brooklyn, added a dog, Romeo, to our little family, scoured the
    nation for the best fried chicken sandwich (it’s Roaming Rooster!), and
    begun to start our own traditions. We can’t wait to celebrate our love among
    family and friends so soon!

    I’ll elaborate on the series of random events that led me to Carly. I remember seeing Carly in 2016 around the time she was swearing in to be an official Peace Corps volunteer. I had been in the country (Dominican Republic) for a year, acting a fool. Most of the current Peace Corps volunteers always come to the capital of the country to watch the 'newbies' take their oaths to become official Peace Corps volunteers. I saw her across the room during some post-swear-in activities and crudely thought, 'Wow, she’s a babe.' I immediately wanted to talk to her.
  </div>,
  <div>
    I didn't though. I even had a friend come up to me at a Peace Corps party we were both at, and she asked, 'Who are you eyeing?' I said, 'That girl right there.' For reference, I was pointing at Carly. My friend offered to talk to Carly and facilitate a chat, but I chickened out and said, 'Naw.'
  </div>,
  <div>
    Would be crazy if that’s how the story ended! Fair warning, the following obtuse amount of information may seem random, but I attribute every random occurrence to meeting my forever love and best friend.
  </div>,
  <div>
    Fast-forward two months, a whole bunch of volunteers were heading to the capital of our country of service to celebrate Thanksgiving. I dropped in the day after Thanksgiving (hence late) to the festivities for honestly no reason. I was only planning to stay in the capital for a few days, so I packed terribly light, so light that I had, in fact, two pairs of clothes, one of which I was wearing. Later during that visit, a few friends wanted to grab dinner at a casual spot, so as a joke and as a person with no clean clothes, I just went to our Peace Corps lost and found and put on any and all things that were green. I found a green bucket hat with a 'Dokey The Bear' logo, some random football jersey for a high school that I didn't attend, and some goofy University of Oregon basketball shorts that were (you guessed it) green. I looked pretty stupid. My friends promised we’d come back to the hotel for me to change into some other clothes before we went out dancing.
  </div>,
  <div>
    Well, we didn't return to the hotel. After dinner, my friends wanted to directly go dancing. Looking like a green idiot, I was (of course) stopped by the bouncer from entering the (honestly not that nice) dance club all my friends wanted to get into. Not trying to ruin the fun, I just headed home and planned to take an L for the night.
  </div>,
  <div>
    Being honestly pretty bummed and not at all tired, I decided to lounge in one of the common areas of the hotel all of us volunteers were staying at. In a particular mood and in my feelings, I put on Christmas music on some portable speakers and sat in the completely empty common area by myself. After an embarrassing amount of time, I hear someone heading my direction, and what will you have it, the gorgeous, curly-haired, blue-eyed bombshell I chickened out on speaking with two months prior approached me, interested in what I was doing. It was an immediate connection, and I’m beyond shocked considering I looked pretty pathetic (remember, completely green mismatched outfit, listening to Christmas music, by myself, in a Dominican Republic hotel). We talked for what felt like forever that night, and I wanted forever to last.
  </div>,
  <div>
    For the next couple of months, I’d do anything I could do to talk to this amazing person. I’d climb hills around my volunteer site, waving my phone in the air like an idiot trying to capture any sort of cellular signal to talk to her for any amount of time. I could stand around for hours listening to her voice, learning what made her tick, nailing down what made her laugh, and falling deeply in love. I marveled at how deeply she cared about others, how goofy she could be around me, and how sharp her focus was on what she wanted and how she wanted to make a difference in this world.
  </div>,
  <div>
    Through Peace Corps, graduate school, living in D.C., and now in New York City, I’m so glad the most random series of events led me to the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I’m continually in awe of how our love has seen growth and evolution through many different versions of the people we have been the last 7 years and the different versions we will be throughout the rest of our lives. I’m excited for every minute of it.
